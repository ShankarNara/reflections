6. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: A folder has to be initialized into a repository so that the files created in that folder can be tracked and that all git commands work on the files.

7. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a way of listing out all the files we want changed and committed to the repository . It helps us commit multiple files all at once.

8. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

9. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A:The branch feature helps us to implement a doubtful improvisation on the code file without unnecessarily populationg the commit area . Finally only the successful version of branch is committed.

10. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A: diagrmas give us a visual map of how all the commits made , including both the master and branch commits.

11. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A: the result of merging 2 branches is a single project instance that contains a combination of features from both the project instances.
We represent merging that way to give the idea that - what was once 2 instances of the project will henceforth run as 1 single instance.

12.What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

A: pros - git has the technological sophistication to make the right merges 99% of the times so it saves developers a lot of time.cons - merging in gits auto merging will still reveal some conflicts in code.
